Sprite Animation Assignment For TCSS-491

Assingment Details

In this solo assignment you will use the base code provided to animate a sprite sheet (or sheets) of your
choosing. The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to become familiar with the Asset Manager and
Game Engine base code, while practicing coding in JavaScript and building your first example of an
animated entity. The practice you get working on this assignment is intended to help you be the best asset
possible for your team when working on the project. Follow these steps to complete this assignment:

1. Watch the YouTube Videos on animation. The week 1 and 2 videos cover topics including an
introduction to JavaScript, a review of the provided base code, and a demonstration of how to
animate a simple sprite sheet. Watch these videos in preparation for completing the assignment.
Some of the later videos can be completed along with the following steps.

2. Download the base code. You can find an empty version of the game engine here. Download
the code and create your own repository for your animation on your local drive and on your own
GitHub account. Push the empty version of the game engine as your first commit.

3. Create a live version of your animation. On the GitHub repository go to “Settings” scroll down
to “GitHub pages” and select the “master” branch as your GitHub pages Source. This will
publish your animation live on GitHub’s servers as URL <user>.github.io/<repo>/ allowing you
to publish your animation for free.

4. Find an original sprite sheet. Use Google to find a fun sprite sheet to animate by using search
terms like “robot sprite sheet” or “dragon sprite sheet”. You can find many helpful resources,
although finding good resources that can be used to produce high quality animations can be time
consuming.

5. Animate the sprite sheet. Use the Asset Manager to load the sprite sheet into memory. Then
create an entity with an update() and draw() method and add it to the Game Engine. Finally,
modify the Animator class to work with your sprite sheet to create one or more animations from
your sprite sheet.

6. (Optional) Have fun with your animation. Animate your figure running, jumping, shooting,
dancing, or whatever else the spritesheet can do. Have fun and show off what you learned.

7. Submit your animation. Commit your final animation to GitHub and submit your live link to
Canvas (not the link to your repository). If you would like to share you work with your fellow
students jump on Discord and share you animation in the #animations text chat. Remember to
view other’s work with compassion and use the “thumbs up” emoji on animations that you think
are awesome!
